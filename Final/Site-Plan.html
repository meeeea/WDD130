        I am Justin Hutchens. I will/have graduated high-school April 12th 2025. I will serve / have served a mission from May of 2025 to May 2027 to the Sendi Japan Mission. I was homeschooled for my enducation up until I began concurent enrollment at BYU-I.
        From ages 9 to 14, I studied piano, I eventualy switched to spend more time studying programming.
        I seek to enter a computer science or electrical engineering field in the future, though I do not currently know which I want more.

      <h3>education</h3>
      <p>
        When I was 14, I decided I wanted to learn programing. I had no formal background in computer scienceâ€”just a curiosity about how software worked and a desire to build something of my own. I wasn't sure where to start, but then I was told about Harvard's CS50x, one of Harvard's programing courses which they have available online to take for free. It sounded intimidating at first, but the fact that it was free and self-paced convinced me to give it a shot.
        I studied CS50 with much vigor, eventualy completing three of their courses, CS50X, CS50P, and CS50g, ending my CS50 adventure with a strong bassis is data science, web development, game development, and programming systems. 
        My schooling was done through a co-op system. My family would meet regularly with other home schooling families to learn more difficult subjects such as science, history, and writing. This would allow each of the teachers to focus better on their designated class. Allowing them to know more of their lesson and be better able to teach it. 
        Years later I started BYU-I's concurent enrollment program. As of the end of the 2025 winter symester, I will have completed calculus, college writing, college physics, and numerous computer science courses. Amounting to a total of 30 Credits.

      <p>
        1. My father has taught me many things. I have acheived an introductory level of understanding in fields such as plumbing, electrical, flooring, and walling.
        2. I have worked in customer service for 2 years. Working at Skechers as a retail associate provided a solid foundation in customer service, sales, teamwork, and problem-solving. The experience taught me how to interact with people, stay patient under pressure, and adapt to fast-paced environments, all while ensuring customers left the store satisfied.
        3. I have a working knoledge of the mechanical systems of moterized engins. I have learned both both technical expertise and problem-solving abilities. Beyond fixing cars, the role builds skills in critical thinking, safety, customer service, and teamwork, all of which are essential for success in the industry.
