            1. My father has taught me many things. I have acheived an introductory level of understanding in fields such as plumbing, electrical, flooring, and walling.
            2. I have worked in customer service for 2 years. Working at Skechers as a retail associate provided a solid foundation in customer service, sales, teamwork, and problem-solving. The experience taught me how to interact with people, stay patient under pressure, and adapt to fast-paced environments, all while ensuring customers left the store satisfied.
            3. I have a working knoledge of the mechanical systems of moterized engins. I have learned both both technical expertise and problem-solving abilities. Beyond fixing cars, the role builds skills in critical thinking, safety, customer service, and teamwork, all of which are essential for success in the industry.
